values contains the array elements and size describes the length of the array
Some example arrays and expected output are given below:
Array: [ 13, 16, 16, 7, 7]
Your ouput: 13
Array: [ 8, 8, 8]
Your ouput: There is No Second Smallest
Array: [ 7, 7, 6]
Your ouput: 7
Array: [ 8, 7]
Your ouput: 8
Array: [3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 5]
Your ouput: 5
